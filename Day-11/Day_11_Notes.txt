CGI Vs Servlets

Servlets Vs JSP's

Client And Server Architecure

Steps To Execute First Web Application..


CGI Technology: 

>> Common Gate Way Interface

>> It Was developed based on C language and Shell Scripting 

>> C is a Procedural Oriented Language.

>> And It was a Process Based Technology.



			[
				Employee Management System 		||
				==========================
	 Request@1
Client @1 =======>		Web Resource @1		   	||	[ WR@1 == Req@1  ] 
									Process@1
	  WR@1
						Web Resource @2		   	||
	 Request@2
Client @2=======>		..etc			   		||	[ WR@1== Req@2   ]
													Process@2
	WR@1
				] CGI Container		  			||

>> Process is a heavy weight componenet that means it consumes
	 more number of system resoures.

>> 1000 Requests

>> What about Server Internal Memory and Process?


Servlets:

	1) Servlets Are Technology From Sun Micro Systems [ Java ]

	2) Java Supports Multi Threading

			[
				Employee Management System 		||
				==========================
	 Request@1									==> Thread1@ Client Request@1
Client @1 =======>		Web Resource @1		    ||	[    ] Servlet Object
	  WR@1
				Web Resource @2		   			||	===> Thread2@ Clinet Request@2
	 Request@2
Clinet @2=======>					    		||	
	Wr@1
				] Servlets Container	   		||


>> Thread is a light wieght componenet and it consumes less system resources.
Servlets Vs Jsp's:

	1) If we want to develope a web application purely based on 
		Servlets Technology then we need complete knowledge on Core Java Concepts.

			Purely Jsp's: Minimum Knowledge is enough.

	2) Servlets Are very good at the time pickuping the request 
		and processing the request.

		        Jsp's: Delivering The Response With Look and Feel

	3) In Servlets There are no separate tags for Presentation
		 logic and Business logic. 

			Jsp's: We are having seperate tags for 
 			presentation logic and separate tags for business logic.

	4) In Servlets for any modification in the code, 
		we need re compilation and re deploying the servlet.

			But Jsp's are Said to be auto compiled 
			and auto loaded technology.

	5) MVC - Design Pattren

		M - Model	====> Core Java's, DAO, VO, BO etc..

		V - View	===> Jsp's

		C - Controller	===> Servlets

		Struts 1.X ==> ActionServlet ===> Controller
			       JSP Pages     ===> View

		Struts 2.X ==> FilterDispatcher ==> Controller
				JSP Pages 	===> View


Web Applications:

	1) Client And Server Architecture

		>> Client

		>> Protocol

		>> Server

URL Syntax:

	ProtocolName://IP Address:portNumber//ApplicationContextName//WebResourceName(QS)

	>> http://10.123.234.256:8080//EMS//Login.jsp(QS);

	IP Address 	: Unique identification number over a network to identify the PC

		     	Responsible: Network Adminstrator

	Port Number 	: Unique Identification number given for 
				each and every process in the system.

			 Responsible: System Adminstrator

	Query String 	: The Collection Of Name And Value Pairs Which 
			are going to append at the end of the URL is Said To Be 
			  Query String

>> Ideal Properties Of A Protocol:

	>> Connection Less Nature

	>> Stateless Nature 

	>> Compatible 

>> How You Are Justifying Http Protocol statisfies stateless nature?

>> Diff Between WebServer and ApplicationServer ?

>> Diff Between IP Address and Port Number?

>> Diff between CGI and Servlets, Servlets and JSP's?

>> Tiered Architectures : 1 Tier, 2 Tier, 3 Tier etc.. N Tier 

>> Logical Layers Of Enterprise Applications?

		>> User Interface Layer

		>> Business Logic Layer

		>> Data Storage and Access Layer [ Persistance Layer ]

Steps To Create A First Web Application:

	1) Create A Web Application Directory Structure

	2) Writing Deployement Descriptor [ web.xml ] 

	3) Writing the web resources as part of your applications requirement

	4) Deployee The Web Application in a Server

	5) Accessing The Applications From Client Browsers

Servlet:
========
	>> Servlet is nothing but a server side object, 
		and it is giving dynamic response for the client request.

	>> Servlet is either directly or indirectly dependent on Servlet Interface.

>> javax.servlet.*;
>> javax.servlet.http.*;
>> servlet-api.jar file

	>> Servlet is nothing but an Object,
		being available at Server Machine,
	   capable to handle the client request, 
	   and genarating static or dynamic response
	   based on the underlyining java code.
	>> And dependents on either directly or inderectly on Servlet Interface.
	
	
Servlet Interface:
==================
5 Life Cycle Methods of Servlet Interface

>> javax.servlet.*;	


  public abstract void init(ServletConfig config)throws ServletException;		

  public abstract void service(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response)
					throws ServletException,IOException;

  public abstract ServletConfig getServletConfig()throws ServletException;

  public abstract String getServletInfo();

  public abstract void destroy();

Interfaces:				Classes:

1) Servlet				1) ServletException

2) ServletRequest		2) GenericServlet Abstract Class

3) ServletResponse		3) HttpServlet Abstract Class

4) HttpServletRequest	4) Cookie	etc..

5) HttpServletResponse

6) ServletConfig

7) ServletContext 

8) Filter

9) RequestDispatcher

10) HttpSession
etc..

						Servlet Interface
							||
							||
						GenericServlet Abstract Class
							||
							||
						HttpServlet Abstract Class
						
 GET 	==> doGet(request,response);
 POST	==> doPost(request,request);
 
 BIG-7 Methods
 
 1) GET Request
 2) POST Request
 3) PUT Request
 4) HEAD Request
 5) TRACE Request
 6) OPTIONS Request
 7) DELETE Request
 
 
public class RegistrationServlet extends HttpServlet{

		// Business Logic
}						
==========
Life Cycle:
==========
>> servlet-api.jar ===> Tomcat/lib ==> servlet-api.jar, jsp-api.jar, el-api.jar..

1) We are placing the servlet-api.jar file into the class path/
  In  Otherwards will be placing this jar file in Build Path

2) Servlet is an object available at server machine, 
	and it is either directly or 
	indirectly depends on Predefined Servlet Interface.

3) import javax.servlet.*

4) Servlet Interface Methods.

		public abstract void init(ServletConfig config)throws ServletException;

		public abstract void service(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response)throws ServletException,IOException;

		public abstract ServletConfig getServletConfig();

		public abstract String getServletInfo();

		public abstract void destroy();

5) Yes it is possible to write the constructor inside of a servlet,
	but the constructor sholud be public and no argument constructor.

	Request [./RegistrationServlet]
Reg.html==========>	web.xml  ===> RegistrationServlet.java

					===============> If it is first request. 
								Then Servlet Object 
								Is Instantiated by
								 the container.
					================>

>> Servlet Byte Code will be loaded 
	to operational memory [ It is Called As Servlet Loading ]

>> Servlet Object will be instantited by the container. 
	[ It is Called As Servlet Instantiation ]

>> As part of the life cycle
	- init method will be called by the container.
	[ It is Called As Servlet Initialization ]

>> A Thread Will be spanned on the servlet Object 
	-and it is trying to access service (doGet, or doPost) method.
		
		>> ServletRequest (HttpServletRequest)
		
		>> ServletResponse (HttpServletResponse)

		>> For each and every thread 
			a sepearate private run time stack will be created.  
		
		>> In Side Of Service(doGet, or doPost) Method 
		We are Writing the Business Logic, 
		As part of the business logic we are getting some dynamic response.
		We are supposed to send this response to client machine.

		>> response.setContentType("text/html");

		>> PrintWriter out=response.getWriter();

		>> We are establishing a logical stream between
			our service(doGet, or doPost)  method and response objects.

		>> A Stream is nothing but a flow of data between source and destination.

		>> Here Source is service(doGet, or doPost) method 
			and destination will be the response object.

		>> After That Thread is reached to dead state.
		
		>> that response object will be directed to client browser.
		
Note: After response reached to client browser.

	As part of the default nature of Http Protocol, 
	the virtual protocol socket connection existed between clinet and server
	will be destroyed.

	1) Connection Less Protocol

	2) Stateless nature

	3) Compatible Protocol.

>> What ever the request you are sending from the client 
	it will be consider as a new request.

>> Now Tomacat container wait for some time,
	if no other request for the same Servlet, 
	Then to maintain memory resources of server.

>> Servlet De-Initialization, Servlet De-Instatiation, Servlet Un-Loading. 

>> How much time the container is waiting for 
	to De-instantiate a servlet depends on Container implementation.

ServletConfig Is An Interface
ServletContext Is An Interface


1) Differences Between	
	ServletConfig And ServletContext ??
	
>> ServletConfig is an object which is going to maintain
   the configuration details of perticular Servlet.

	>> Like Logical Name Of The Servlet

	>> initalization patameters data

	>> reference of the servletcontext object.

>> Servlet Config object will be created by the container
 just after the servlet instantiation and 
just before calling init () as part 	of servlet initialization.

	ServletContext object will be created by the Container 
at the time of starting up of the server.

>> Servlet Config object will be destroyed by the container 
just before the servlet Deinstantiation. 
Due to the above reasons the life of the servlet config object 
is the life of servlet.

	ServletContext life time is entire web application.
	
	Gives data sharability option for us.

Parameter Vs Attributes:

	>> At the time of creation of an object by the container,
 that data which is avialable already such type of data is 
 said to be parameters data.

		===> request.getParameter("empId");
		===> config.getInitParameter("HRA");
		===> context.getInitParameter("dbUserName");

	>> What ever the data which we are going
 to add after object creation such type of data is said to be Attributes data.

		===> request.setAttribute("cityName","Hyderabad");

		===> session.setAttribute("userId",userId);
		
		===> context.setAttribute("loginId",loginId);

>> config object allows only parameters data [ static inclusion ]

>> context object allows both parameters data and attributes data, 
	that means static inclusion and dynamic inclusion also possible.

		 context.setAttribute("loginId",loginId);
		 
		 
Note:

ServletConfig				=======		ServletContext

>> scope is with						>> Scope is Throught The Application
	in the servlet only

>> allows only static inclusion			>> static and Dynamic Inclusion

======================
Session Management:
======================

Ideal Properties:

	>> Connection Less Nature

	>> State Less Nature

	>> Compatible Protocol.

How Http Protocol Maintains its stateless nature?

 >> Not to maintain privious requested data when we are making new request.

 >> Each and every request that sends by 
	the client will be considered as a new request.

>> For Each and Every Web Application We Have Only One Context Object.

>> There is a problem of data security.

	is nothing but a Session.

>> State Of The Session:

	The data which is transferred between clinet and Server during 
a perticular session is nothing but State of The Session.
